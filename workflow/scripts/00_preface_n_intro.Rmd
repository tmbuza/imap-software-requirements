# General Overview
**IMAP** stands for **Integrated Microbiome Analysis Pipelines**. 
IMAP comprises different parts. Each part represents a standalone GitHub repository. 
The IMAP parts, when used sequentially, provide a systematic microbiome data analysis beyond the traditional methods.

## IMAP approach
- We use the snakemake workflow management system [@Koster2021; @Snakemake2023] for:
  - Maintaining reproducibility in technical validation and regeneration of results.
  - Creating scalable data analysis scaled to a server, grid, or cloud environment.
  - Fostering sustainable improvement of the microbiome data analysis.
- We break complex workflows into small contiguous but related chunks where each major step forms a separate executable snakemake rule.

## Vision
> We envision fostering continuous integration and improvement of highly reproducible and sustainable workflows for microbiome data analysis.

## Basic software
We must install all essential tools to get started and ensure they run smoothly. Examples of required software include:

- Environment and package management system.
- Workflow management system.
- Quality control tools.
- Bioinformatics analysis pipelines.
- Data analysis software.
- More tools as needed.
