<!-- <a href=""><img src="images/rlogoblue.png" alt="R Software" width="10" style="padding: 0 15px; float: left;"/></a> -->
**R** is a free software for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphics [@RCoreTeam2021]. We need to install R application on a personal computer to process the R programming language. You can download and install R using these steps:

1. Go to [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/).
2. On the left, under Download, click on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) to access the mirrors. CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) is mirrored on nearly 100 registered servers in nearly 50 regions world. See [CRAN mirror status](https://cran.r-project.org/mirmon_report.html).
3. https://cloud.r-project.org/ Pick a mirror that is close to your location, and automatically R will connect to that server ready to download the package files.
4. Select a compatible platform to download precompiled binary distributions of the base system, which also come with contributed packages.

## Install RStudio Environment {#rstudio-ide}

<!-- <a href=""><img src="images/rstudio.png" alt="RStudio" width="10" style="padding: 0 15px; float: left;"/></a> -->

**RStudio** is a free program that integrates with R as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to implement most of the analytical functionalities [@RStudioTeam2021].  For effective analysis, we must install R before installing RStudio. We will intensively use RStudio IDE to give us a user interface. We are interested in **RStudio Desktop**, which is the open-source regular desktop application. You can install it like this:

1. Go to [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).
2. Click on [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop) box to move to the open source edition.
3. Choose your preferred [license](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) either open source or commercial.
4. Select [installer](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) compatible to your operating system.

```

### Installing and loading packages from CRAN
```{}
install.packages("packagename")
library("packagename")
```


### Installing and loading R packages from Bioconductor
```{}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
library("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("packagename")}
library("packagename")
```

### Installing and loading R packages from GitHub

```{}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("r-lib/devtools")
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("githubID/packagename")

```


### Getting Help in R

### Show basic package information 

```{}
help("packagename")

or

?packagename

help(package = "packagename")

```

### Get a general overview
```{}
help(functionname)

or

help(functionname, package = "packagename")

```

### Remove unneeded packages from your computer 

```{}
remove.packages("packagename")
```

### Unload a package 

```{}
detach("package::packagename")
```

### Citing R, RStudio or a package
