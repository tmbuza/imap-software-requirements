<!-- # Mapping Files -->

## Mothur mapping files
The mapping files are required to direct the pipeline where to look for the files containing the sequencing data.

- The format of the mapping files for `mothur` and `QIIME2` pipelines is slightly different. 
- We will demonstrate how to prepare both.
- Each mapping file will contain only the files that are parsed by bioinformatics analysis.
