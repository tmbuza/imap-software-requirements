<!-- # General Overview -->
## What is metadata?
* <b>Metadata</b> is a set of data that describes and provides information about other data. It is commonly defined as **data about data**.
* **Sample metadata** described in this book refers to the description and context of the individual sample collected for a specific microbiome study.

## Metadata structure
* Metadata collected at different stages (Figure 1) are typically organized in an Excel or Google spreadsheet where:
  * The metadata table columns represent the properties of the samples.
  * The metadata table rows contain information associated with the samples.
  * Typically, the first column of sample metadata is Sample ID, which designates the key associated to individual sample
  * Sampl ID must be unique.

## Embedded metadata
* In most cases, you will find the metadata detached from the experimental data.
* Embedded metadata integrates the experimental data especially for graphics.
* Major microbiome analysis platforms require sample metadata, commonly referred to as **mapping file** when performing downstream analysis.
